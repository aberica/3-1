%% Introduction
% You will explore and understand the various techniques and strategies
% employed for undersampling in the frequency domain.

% The objective of this assignment is to undersample 160x160 human face
% images in the frequency domain by a factor of 4 while maximizing the peak
% signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR).

% For training purposes, you will be provided with a set of 10 images, and
% for validation, one image will be given. Please note that test images
% will not be made available.

% Using the provided training and validation images, your task is to submit
% a 160x160 undrsampling mask. 
% 
% The mask should be a binary 2D matrix of size 160x160, with exactly one-fourth(1/4) of the entries being 1, and
% the remaining three-fourths(3/4) being 0.

%% 1. Load images into array

% Load 10 images of train dataset in 'image_train' using
% 'load_images_to_array' function.

path_train='dataset/train/';
image_train=load_images_to_array(path_train, 160);

% visualize the sample image
figure;
sample_img=squeeze(image_train(10,:,:));
imshow(sample_img,'DisplayRange',[0, 255]);

%% 2. 1/4 Undersample reconstruction of the validation (you) and test data(TA)

path_val='dataset/val/';
image_val=load_images_to_array(path_val,160);

% Move the image to frequency domain
kspace_val=fftshift(fft2(squeeze(image_val)));
figure;
imshow(20*log(abs(kspace_val)),[0,255]);

%% 3. Optimize the mask 

% The mask below is an example provided by the TA.
% You should optimize your own mask, but the mask should strictly meet
% requirements below.

% Requirements :
% The mask should be a binary 2D matrix of size 160x160, with exactly one-fourth(1/4) of the entries being 1, and
% the remaining three-fourths(3/4) being 0.

% In optimization process, it is highly recommended that you try sample and
% reconstruct images in train dataset with various types of mask multiple
% times

% TA will use the test images that demonstrate similar patterns to the
% training images

% The higher the PSNR value, the higher the score for your assignment!
